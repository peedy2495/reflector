# reflector

## Intruduction

A tool for pulling different apt- and rpm-based repositories via rsync or web with automated config creation for related repositories via private web-provision.

## WARNING!

Be aware that most repositories need a huge amount of disk-space!  
It's recommended to store your pulls into a separate Volume.

## Startup

Add the executable flag to reflector.sh  
Start reflector.sh after modifying related configuration-files.  
Repository config files for rpm-sources will be stored in [basedest]/.repofiles.  
apt-configs are not supported yet ...
