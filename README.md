# reflector

## Intruduction
A tool for pulling different apt- and rpm-based repositories via rsync or web with automated config creation for related repositories via private web-provision.
<br/><br/>

## WARNING!
Be aware that most repositories are eating a huge amount of disk-space!  
It's recommended to store your pulls into a separate Volume.
<br/><br/>

## Startup
Add the executable flag to `reflector.sh`  
Start `reflector.sh` after modifying related configuration-files.  
Repository config files for rpm-sources will be stored in [basedest]/.repofiles.  
Repository config files for apt-sources will be stored in [basedest]/.apt.
<br/><br/>

## **Configuration**

### config/reflector.conf
basedest - main store for all pulled repositories  
repourl - basic URL where your webservice resides.
<br/><br/>

### config/../apt-keyring.conf
keyring - path to trustedkeys.gpg to be able to copy the repository 
Example Import of a downloaded public GPG-Key  
```
wget https://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/7/rsa.pub -P [basedest]/.keys/keypath
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring [keyring] --import [basedest]/.keys/keypath/rsa.pub
```
Required GPG-Keys have to be imported into the clients, too. 

### config/../yum-gpgkeys.conf
keys - array of URLs to public gpgkeys related to used repositories  
These will only be downloaded to [basedets]/.keys and have to be imported into the clients
<br/><br/>

### Repository configs
All config files may placed to different subfolders.
Some sample Folders and config Files (disabled) are included to get closer with the configuration. Regarding to apt, don't forget to import needed GPG-Keys before trying any apt-configs.
There are three types of Repository Configs

```
<br/><br/>
