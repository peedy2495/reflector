# reflector

## Intruduction
A tool for pulling different apt- and rpm-based repositories via rsync or web with automated config creation for related repositories via private web-provision.
<br/><br/>

## WARNING!
Be aware that most repositories are eating a huge amount of disk-space!  
It's recommended to store your pulls into a separate Volume.
<br/><br/>

## Startup
Add the executable flag to `reflector.sh`  
Start `reflector.sh` after modifying related configuration-files.  
Repository config files for rpm-sources will be stored in [basedest]/.repofiles.  
<br/><br/>

## **Configuration**

### config/reflector.conf
basedest - main store for all pulled repositories  
repourl - basic URL where your webservice resides.
<br/><br/>

### config/../apt-keyring.conf

<br/><br/>

### config/../yum-gpgkeys.conf

<br/><br/>
